# HolyGPT
This project is an ai chat web application based on distilgpt2 model meant to finish text inputted by user in the style of Polish Bible. User can also fiddle with model settings like temperature or top_k values. It's style was strongly inspired by the one and only TempleOS created by R.I.P Terry A. Davis. In TempleOS you could generate pseudo random "word from God", this tries to resemble that but it's less random.
